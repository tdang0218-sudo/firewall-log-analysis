**Summary**
---
Hydra was used to attempt brute force RDP on the target machine. Just like the SSH brute force, the RDP attack used a list of passwords
in a notepad and tries to log-in in quick succession. RDP attempts many connections over port 3389 and is usually used when an
attacker wants full GUI desktop access.
