# SOC Firewall Analysis Project

## Overview
This is a SOC oriented project that simulates attacker activity against a target workstation. The goal of this project is to demonstrate skills such as traffic monitoring, log analysis, and attack detection, as well as to gain insight as to what SOC analysts might come across when monitoring firewall logs.
