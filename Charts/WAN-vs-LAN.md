**Analysis**
---
This is a chart shown in pfSense. We can see here that there is much more WAN traffic than LAN. In the 
lab set up Kali was placed on the WAN interface (em0) and Windows was on LAN (em1), sitting between them 
was pfSense. If we were to look at this from a SOC analyst perspective, we can conclue that this chart 
indicates that an attack is happening outside of the network.
