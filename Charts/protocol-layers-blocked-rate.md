**Analysis**
---
The graph above shows the type of protocols pfSense has blocked. Most of the recorded attacks were TCP, which lines up with the
destination ports seen in earlier pictures. Some attacks that pfSense recorded included RDP and SSH brute force attacks, scanning of
the network, and reconnaissance which are all attacks that usually uses TCP.
