The graph above shows the type of protocols pfSense has blocked. Most of the recorded attacks were TCP, which lines up with the
destination ports seen in earlier pictures. Some ports that were recorded included 22, 3389, 1, and 135 which indicates brute force
attempts, scanning, and reconnaissance which are all attacks that uses TCP.
